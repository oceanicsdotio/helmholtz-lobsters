# American lobsters change orientation in response to magnetic field reversals

Lobsters rely on powerful sensory capabilities during all life stages, and adults can  accurately find their way home over 200 km. Migrations of the spiny lobster are accomplished using the geomagnetic field. I proved this is also true in *H americanus*, by reversing the polarity of the local magnetic field. Understanding this ability has applications in population connectivity and ocean energy planning.

## Introduction

Larval American lobsters (*Homarus americanus*) live suspended in surface waters, carried long distances by ocean currents. After their pelagic phase, individuals become competent forward-swimming post-larvae (stage IV) and settle as they encounter suitable habitat (Factor 1995). Settlement is influenced by local physical processes, but there is also evidence of complex navigation (Kingsford et al 2002, Cooper & Uzmann 1971) using photo- and geotaxis in search of shelter (Kingsford et al 2002), and rheotaxis and olfaction to follow chemical signals to their source (Boudreau et al 1993). Foraging juveniles return to the same shelter night after night without visual cues (Karnofsky et al 1989), and adults embark on migrations >200 km and can home to known geographic areas (Cooper & Uzmann 1971). 

Marine and terrestrial organisms are known to sense magnetic field inclination and polarity, and use geomagnetic cues to migrate (Cain et al 2005). Spiny lobster (*Panulirus argus*) navigate using geomagnetic orientation, demonstrated through displacement and induced directional preference trials (Boles & Lohmann 2003, Lohmann et al 1995). The navigation capabilities of *H. americanus* suggests they may share this sensory mechanism. This study demonstrates re-orientation in juveniles in response to reversal of the local magnetic field. 

## Methods

### Specimens

Recently-molted stage VI-VII juveniles (CL=8.8±0.5 mm, N=10) hatched and raised at the New England Aquarium Lobster Research Facility were used in the experiment. These were kept in individual mesh tubes in aerated 15 °C artificial seawater, with a 12:12 hr light schedule, and fed *Artemia* daily. 

Each was blindfolded with black plastic, wrapped under the rostrum and eyes and secured to the carapace with cyanoacrylic adhesive. Covering the eyestalks prevents orienting to light without harming the animal (Lohmann et al. 1995, Deutschlander et al 1999). Lobsters did not react to motion, while their ability to eat and walk was unaffected.

A cotton thread was glued to the plastic to prevent contact with tank walls. Individuals made unsuccessful attempts to remove tethers immediately after affixing, but otherwise ignored them.

### Electromagnetic field

Two square electromagnetic were constructed from 22 turns of 16-gauge insulated copper wire around 150 cm ($L$) PVC frames spaced 82 cm apart to create a 50 cm area with <0.5% variation in field strength (Lohmann et al 1995, Firester 1966). The electrical resistances ($R$), including power supply leads, were 1.85 and 2.05 Ω (Fluke 8050A multimeter).

The apparatus was setup in the laboratory such that apparent north varied <5° within the coils. Magnetometer measurements showed a horizontal field component of 0.238-0.245 Gauss, meaning the coils needed to produce $B$=0.478 G to reverse apparent north.

The required supply voltages ($V$) were 3.41 and 3.50 based on Firester's equation (1966) and Ohm’s law, $V = {B \cdot L^2 \cdot R} \over 6.218. The round corners of the frame (5 cm ø) were ignored in the calculation. The coils produced $B$=0.415 G, resulting in a 300° deflection in apparent north.

### Arena

The arena was a circular plastic basin (28 cm ø). The bottom was covered with a uniform layer of mixed fine and coarse sand. The tank was centered in the coils at 75 cm height. Water was replaced between trials (depth = 5 cm) and sediment allowed to settle. A transparent plastic cover was divided into 30° sectors, with north marked, and a hole for securing the tether. A tripod-mounted DV camera filmed downward through the cover. The PVC frame for the coils was draped with black plastic sheet to prevent glare in the recording, and to reduce shadows that might bias behavioral trials. 


### Trials

In baseline trials (Type 1, N=11, Trials 1-11) each lobster was corralled (4 cm ø) during a 5-12 minute acclimation, then freely wandered for 20 minutes. Video was converted to an image sequence with one minute intervals, starting when the corral was removed. Lobsters tended to reach the wall of the tank and follow it, reversing direction at random. Most settled in the relative safety of depressions in the sand substrate against the tank wall. Based on this, I used tethers in further trials.

For the initial EMF trials, two lobsters were recorded every 60 seconds while tethered and blindfolded for a 10-20 minute acclimation period, during which the Helmholtz coils were not activated (Type 2A, N=2, 12 & 14). Then each specimen was left in the arena for an additional 20 minute trial in which the electromagnetic field was reversed once at 10 minutes (Type 2B, N=2, 13 & 15).

Two further trials had coil state toggled every 2 minutes (Type 3, N=2, 16 & 17). Many of the reversals had to be eliminated due to interaction with the tether, so in further trials switching was done opportunistically every 15–60 seconds as lobsters were crossing the middle of the arena (Type 4, N=7).

## Results

A reorientation event was defined as a 90° change in heading, not within the 60 seconds following an interaction with the arena or tether. Continuous circling was evaluated as an event for every revolution.

Baseline trials (Type 1) did not show obvious directional preference.

Figure: average heading during baseline trials (Type 1) (N=6). Direction is vector average of 20 positions, length is an indicator of  course consistency. Following the tank wall results in a short vector.

Control trials (Type 2A) showed erratic movement, but no settling. Lobsters reaching the end of a tether would either (a) strain against it, (b) turn tangential to the radius and walk at the limit of the string, or (c) be lifted off the substrate by tension. Entanglement occurred in only one case, though in several cases the tether fouled on itself. This did not affect mobility, only the radius of movement. Slack was added in cases where the small radius caused constant directional change. If the lobster reached the wall, the tether was shortened the next time it was not under tension.

Figure: Sector positions of two lobsters during blind tether trials with no reversals (Type 2A). This shows a possible bias to 270° (West), but seems coincidental when examining video instead of still images.

In Type 2B a field reversal caused an instantaneous heading change (100%, N=2). One lobster was at the limit of the tether in the southern arena, heading east. It turned inward and completed a narrow loop before again reaching the end of the tether an resuming its counterclockwise course. The second was straining against the tether and moving clockwise in the northern arena; it also turned in and passed through the center of the arena, and reaching the opposite wall began a counterclockwise course.

A series of reversals (Type 3) showed discernible reactions in some cases (44%, N=18), but the tether made it difficult to establish the cause of directional changes. This increased to 72% if including reactions that may have been related but were not the defined >90° turn. Of 27 non-random reversals (Type 4) performed over 11.75 min, 9 were ignored because the lobster was at the extent of the tether (including positive, negative and possible reactions). An obvious change in behavior occurred in 12 cases (67%, N=18). With a more lenient criteria for a related event there potentially would be 89% coincidence. There were 47 total reorientation events, occurring in 33% of 5 s time intervals.


## Discussion

A major concern in evaluating frequency of reactions was the functional definition of what constituted a response. In general, non-associated events were given more leniency, and associated events only counted if there appeared to be no other justifiable cause. Simply reducing the correspondence interval after a switch in polarity to 3 s reduces the probability of a single event occurring in any given time bin to 29% and reduces definite responses (IIIc) to 50% of reversals.

If using instantaneous reactions (1 s), the probably of an event happening in any second is 0.07; and a definite responses occurred in 39% of reversals. Simplifying the lobsters behavior by giving more room to establish linear paths would aid in recognizing true events (and not throwing away potential data because of confounding factors).

Regardless, reorientation occurred in both moving and stationary lobsters at the instant of reversal. Particularly spectacular changes in orientation matched exactly the rotation of the compass arm used to confirm field change. Two other behavioral responses were observed. In cases of frequent reversal for more than 15 min two lobster  made jerky vibratory movements and appeared agitated. This happened after reversals, and was followed by the lobster grasping one claw with the other, like wringing hands. When lobsters were stationary during reorientation, they would sometimes roll their tail in and pause before or during a turn. Lobsters would also stop and exhibit this behavior during field reversals. This might indicate that tail is acting as a sort of biological Hall effect sensor. Analyses of trace metals and electric fields in the lobster body might reveal more regarding the sensory mechanism. I have no explanation for the claw-wringing behavior. 

Because of the simplicity of component vector addition, three such arrays can be aligned to x- y- and z-axes, and allow greater control of the uniform area. If the design includes Hall probes to sense each axial component of the field, a CPU can dynamically shift the power supplied to the coils. A moored system in constant motion could maintain a field of uniform magnitude a direction regardless of its instantaneous orientation; DC supplied devices are also inherently suited to battery operation. 

The ability to change the apparent orientation of the Earth's field has applications in study of competent dispersal and population connectivity which may be driven by magnetic navigation. One possible application is *in situ* testing of larval orientation, particularly whether *H. americanus* post-larvae utilize a polarity compass in their settlement strategy and how this might affect species distribution.
